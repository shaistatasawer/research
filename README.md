I am new programer and still learning small things like if statments, loops, fuctions and little bit of oop. When I start coding first time, I just try to make it work, but now I learn little bit about good coding princples. These princples help me make my code more clean, more easy to read, and not so much messy. I still not perfect but I try every time when I write something new.

KISS

One important princple I like is KISS, that mean keep it simple stupid. When I start to write code before, I always try to make it big or fancy. But then I get confuse and make many mistakes. Now I learn it is better to make it small and simple. Simple code I can read after one week and still understand what I did. Also simple program break less, so I not spend so much time fixing bugs. I always tell myself, if I can make it easy, then I should not make it hard.

DRY

Another one is DRY, don’t repeet yourself. I used functions to write onece and use multiple times.  I use to write same lines again and again in many places. Then when I need to change one thing, I forget to change it everywhere and my program stop working. Now I make fuctions and just call them. It save time and make my code shorter. Also when I need to fix something, I only fix one place, not ten times. This princple make my code much more easy to handle.

Single Responsibility

I also try to follow single responsiblity princple. That mean one part of code should do only one job. For example, a class does only one job as i did in second assessment.  Before I make one big fuction that do everything — take input, do math, print result, all in one. But now I split it. One fuction take input, one fuction do the math, one fuction show output. It is more clean and if one part break, I know where to look. It help me to find errors more fast and not get confuse.

Yagni

I remember also YAGNI, you aint gonna need it. This one mean I should not add extra features or code just because maybe one day I will need it. Before I use to write too many things that not needed. It make my code slow and hard to understand. Now I just write what I need for now. Later if I need something new, I can add it. It make life easy and keep my program simple.

refactoring

Sometimes after I finish, I look at my code again and I clean it a bit. I try to fix name of fuctions and remove useless lines. I think this is like refactor but I not do it perfect, I just make it more clear for me.

I still learning every day, but using these few princples help me a lot. My code is not perfect but now it look more clean and I can understand it again later. I learn that good code is not only about making it work, it also about making it simple, easy, and nice to read.
